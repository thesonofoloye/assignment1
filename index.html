        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Al-ameen Oloye, a third year student of
          <strong> Computer Science</strong> in the prestigious
          <strong> University of Ilorin </strong>. I'm currently a student of
          Altschool pursuing a diploma in backend engineering (python). My
          Altschool ID is <strong>ALT/SOE/023/2063</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm the last born child from a family of six so you'll believe there's
          no pressure. But of course there is pressure! Seeing siblings do so
          well in their respectable career fields is enough pressure ever since
          I've been intellectually aware. That's more than enough reason to
          avoid being mediocre.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've had a lot of interests ever since I was young and that is evident
          im how much I have changed career paths. At some point, I wanted to be
          a soldier, then a medical doctor, then a banker before I actually
          settled for a career in computer science. The contrast in these career
          fields is quite evident and it is testament to the fact that I'm very
          dynamic. But the one thing that I'm ever grateful for is that I chose
          a career field in the tech ecosystem. I just discovered it's further
          proof of me being dynamic as the tech space is ever changing.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's this flaw about me that I'm aware of :
          <em>I give up easily</em>. And this has led to a series of
          inconsistency with several online courses. I drop them off whenever I
          feel frustrated. Of course, I'm trying to do better and how do I
          achieve this? I celebrate every small wins as I now believe they are
          the foundation to that <em>bigger win!</em> I think Tabitha Kavyu
          mentioned this in one of the onboarding sessions. Glad to see
          Altschool rubbing off on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I really don't know what else to say but to extend this section
          further, I'll add lorem wordings. I wonder if that's fine? I actually
          want to make my section navigation look sweeter so please pardon me.
          Funny how I couldn't do this few weeks back despite being a student of
          computer science. So please allow my excitement
        </p>

        <h2>Why Altschool?</h2>
        <p>
          Then there's the question of why Altschool? It was frustrating month
          of May for me when I applied. It stemmed from a lack of purpose. I was
          a student of Computer Science and I couldn't even create a simple html
          form. Of course I have been excelling in the theoretical part of my
          course but I knew that I needed the hands on skill that sets me apart
          from the rest. I sure have been taking a lot of online courses but I
          definitely didn't see them through. Took Google's UX/UI design course
          in June,2022 and I dropped it frustrated after I couldn't fit in a
          logo in one of my prototyping lessons. I did UX/UI then because it was
          no code; I didn't want to code as I felt it was fo the big brains and
          my insecurity made me believe I'm not a big brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          So fast forward to January,2023. I was in my second year and we
          started core programming with Java; it was beautiful. I didn't
          understand much but then I knew programming was beautiful. Creating
          lasting technologies for everyday use smacking your fingers on the
          keyboard definitely was enticing. I believe people like that are God's
          favourites.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was doing my research about a field in tech I wanted to pursue when
          I came across Altschool. And then I knew it was for me. The reviews
          were captivating and the fact that the course content were
          sequentially structured was a big deal for me. It was the roadmap I've
          been searching for.
        </p>
        <p>
          And here's another Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing
          elit. Velit cumque consequuntur ab molestias illo nesciunt? Quia sunt
          velit commodi? Quasi tempora, distinctio exercitationem eos veritatis

        <h2>My Goals For the Year</h2>
        <p>
          To be honest, I'm very shallow minded. I don't expect much from the
          world neither do I think the world expects much from me. But there's
          one thing I'm looking forward to; I want to look back and be glad I
          took this step. I want to be in a better place intellectually,morally,
          spiritually and financially. I want to help as many people as
          possible. I want to spread kindness, love and harmony while being a
          badass developer. I just want to make the world a better place!
